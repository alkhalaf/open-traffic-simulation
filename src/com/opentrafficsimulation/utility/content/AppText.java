It has SUMO as simulation server and a Java based GUI program<br/>to create and to modify customized simulations. Also, it has a background service for data storage and reporting system used integration with MySQL.<br/>A signaling control interface for modifying traffic lights on running simulation is another smart feature of the project.<br/><br/> The projects has a sophisticated, intuitive road editor to design and to modify a road network to be used in the simulation. This road editor is a feature<br/> that makes the project standing one step further with respect to other simulations and SUMO itself. All current traffic simulations are designed by using<br/> XML driven road networks which are hard to create without a visual editor. In this context, the project is aiming to solve this common interaction problem. </html>";
